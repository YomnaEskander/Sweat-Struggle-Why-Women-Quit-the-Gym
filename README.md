# The Gym Equation: Understanding Users, Patterns & Growth
Fitness is a huge part of life, and everyone should be concerned about their physical well-being and after glancing at the women around me, I quickly realized that it wasn't just me who found it difficult to commit to the gym. This fact led me to do research to see whether or not women actually struggle to stick with their gym routines, and if so, why.

## Objective 
The goal of this project is to analyze gym behavior trends among women compared to men, understand the challenges women face in committing to the gym and seeing results, and derive actionable insights that could help improve their fitness journey. In addition, I will be analyzing the gym as a business as well and try to come up with actionable insights that can be used in marketing for the gym.
